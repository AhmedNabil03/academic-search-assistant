      "authors": "Jiawei Zhang",
      "publication_date": "2019-03-11",
      "summary": "In this paper, we aim at providing an introduction to the gradient descent\nbased optimization algorithms for learning deep neural network models. Deep\nlearning models involving multiple nonlinear projection layers are very\nchallenging to train. Nowadays, most of the deep learning model training still\nrelies on the back propagation algorithm actually. In back propagation, the\nmodel variables will be updated iteratively until convergence with gradient\ndescent based optimization algorithms. Besides the conventional vanilla\ngradient descent algorithm, many gradient descent variants have also been\nproposed in recent years to improve the learning performance, including\nMomentum, Adagrad, Adam, Gadam, etc., which will all be introduced in this\npaper respectively.",

      "summary": "Deep reinforcement learning augments the reinforcement learning framework and\nutilizes the powerful representation of deep neural networks. Recent works have\ndemonstrated the remarkable successes of deep reinforcement learning in various\ndomains including finance, medicine, healthcare, video games, robotics, and\ncomputer vision. In this work, we provide a detailed review of recent and\nstate-of-the-art research advances of deep reinforcement learning in computer\nvision. We start with comprehending the theories of deep learning,\nreinforcement learning, and deep reinforcement learning. We then propose a\ncategorization of deep reinforcement learning methodologies and discuss their\nadvantages and limitations. In particular, we divide deep reinforcement\nlearning into seven main categories according to their applications in computer\nvision, i.e. (i)landmark localization (ii) object detection; (iii) object\ntracking; (iv) registration on both 2D image and 3D image volumetric data (v)\nimage segmentation; (vi) videos analysis; and (vii) other applications. Each of\nthese categories is further analyzed with reinforcement learning techniques,\nnetwork design, and performance. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis\nof the existing publicly available datasets and examine source code\navailability. Finally, we present some open issues and discuss future research\ndirections on deep reinforcement learning in computer vision",
