Therefore, while the process\\nof natural language processing (NLP) is complex even for human, it is difficult\\nto process in computer system.

With the deep learning methods which are one of the\\nartificial intelligence study areas, platforms close to natural language are\\nbeing developed.

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), one of the deep learning\\narchitectures, is preferred for processing sequential data such as text or\\naudio data. In this study, Turkish POS tagging model has been proposed by using\\nBidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BLSTM) which is an RNN type. The proposed\\nPOS tagging model is provided to natural language researchers with a platform\\nthat allows them to perform and use their own analysis.
